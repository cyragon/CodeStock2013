Submitted Sessions

[1] Let's Build Something Awesome with AngularJS and MVC

Short Version:  An introduction to AngularJS - what it can do and how you would use it in a real app. This isn't just for those SPAs - Single Page Apps - but for real world apps that have real people using them. If you've never heard of AngularJS or have heard of it, but don't know that much about it - this session is for you. We'll build an app using AngularJS focused on a nice front-end and use ASP.NET WebAPI for the backend. AngularJS is a powerful JavaScript framework to help you build awesome apps quickly - and it's powered by Google. That's like awesome x2. Or x4. But you get the point.

If you've used other JavaScript frameworks like KnockoutJS you owe it to yourself to check out AngularJS. Even if it's not this session (which will be the only AWESOME way to find out about it). It's a two-way binding MVVM with REST API buzzword, buzzword, buzzword. And it's awesome.


[2] Database Deployment for the Masses

Short Version:  How would you like to be able to version your database? Be able to upgrade and downgrade with ease? How about not having to rely on a non-existent (or worse, unhelpful) DBA? This session is all that and more! I will use SQL Server, Entity Framework Migrations, Source Control, and a little bit of "process" to show you how we tamed the SQL deployment process and made it a thing of beauty. With nothing more than your bare hands, a little bit of luck, some spare duck tape, and a various other things - you can too! 

Full Version:  Do you love your database versioning and deployment process? Do you work with the best DBAs in the world? Then this session isn't for you. But on a completely unrelated side note, are you hiring?

For the rest of us, how would you like to be able to version your database? Be able to upgrade and downgrade with ease? How about not having to rely on a non-existent (or worse, unhelpful) DBA? This session is all that and more!

You can use Entity Framework Migrations even if you don't use Entity Framework as an ORM.
