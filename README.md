Session

[2] Database Deployment for the Masses

Short Version:  How would you like to be able to version your database? Be able to upgrade and downgrade with ease? How about not having to rely on a non-existent (or worse, unhelpful) DBA? This session is all that and more! I will use SQL Server, Entity Framework Migrations, Source Control, and a little bit of "process" to show you how we tamed the SQL deployment process and made it a thing of beauty. With nothing more than your bare hands, a little bit of luck, some spare duck tape, and a various other things - you can too! 

Full Version:  Do you love your database versioning and deployment process? Do you work with the best DBAs in the world? Then this session isn't for you. But on a completely unrelated side note, are you hiring?

For the rest of us, how would you like to be able to version your database? Be able to upgrade and downgrade with ease? How about not having to rely on a non-existent (or worse, unhelpful) DBA? This session is all that and more!

I will use SQL Server, Entity Framework Migrations, Source Control, and a little bit of &quot;process&quot; to show you how we tamed the SQL deployment process and made it a thing of beauty.

You can use Entity Framework Migrations even if you don't use Entity Framework as an ORM.
